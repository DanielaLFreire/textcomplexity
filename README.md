# Linguistic and Stylistic Complexity #

This project is a collection of measures that assess the linguistic
and stylistic complexity of (literary) texts.

## Measures that use sample size and vocabulary size ##

  * Type-token ratio
  * Guiraud's R
  * Herdan's C
  * Dugast's k
  * Maas' a<sup>2</sup>
  * Dugast's U
  * Tuldava's LN
  * Brunet's W

## Measures that use part of the frequency spectrum ##

  * Honoré's H
  * Sichel's S
  * Michéa's M

## Measures that use the whole frequency spectrum ##

  * Entropy
  * Yule's K
  * Simpson's D
  * Herdan's V<sub>m</sub>

## Parameters of probabilistic models ##

  * Orlov's Z

## Measures that use the whole text ##

  * Covington and McFall's MATTR

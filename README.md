# Linguistic and Stylistic Complexity #

This project is a collection of measures that assess the linguistic
and stylistic complexity of (literary) texts.

## Vocabulary-based complexity measures ##

### Measures that use sample size and vocabulary size ###

  * Type-token ratio
  * Guiraud's R
  * Herdan's C
  * Dugast's k
  * Maas' a<sup>2</sup>
  * Dugast's U
  * Tuldava's LN
  * Brunet's W
  * Carroll's CTTR
  * Summer's S

### Measures that use part of the frequency spectrum ###

  * Honoré's H
  * Sichel's S
  * Michéa's M

### Measures that use the whole frequency spectrum ###

  * Entropy
  * Yule's K
  * Simpson's D
  * Herdan's V<sub>m</sub>
  * McCarthy and Jarvis' HD-D

### Parameters of probabilistic models ###

  * Orlov's Z

### Measures that use the whole text ###

  * Covington and McFall's MATTR
  * MTLD
  * Kubat and Milicka's STTR

## Syntactic complexity measures ##

  * Average sentence length
  * Average punctuation per sentence
  * Average punctuation per token

### Dependency-based measures

  * Average dependency distance
  * Average closeness centrality
  * Average outdegree centralization
  * Average closeness centralization
  * Average longest shortest path
  * Average dependents per token

### Constituent-based measures

Language-independent measures:
  * Average number of constituents
  * Average number of constituents without leaves
  * Average height of the parse trees

Language-dependent measures (defined for German):
  * Average number of t units
  * Average number of complex t units
  * Average number of clauses
  * Average number of dependent clauses
  * Average number of NPs
  * Average number of VPs
  * Average number of PPs
  * Average number of coordinate phrases
